The Multimodal-Research repository is mainly composed of basic schema architecture code such as transformer, mamba, rl, DINO2, moe, etc. Under this repository, there are some other branches of different projects such as transformer, mamba, expert, rl, which consists of basic schema code and variant model architecture code. Each branch has a README.md file to introduce the code, you can read the original file.

Currently, my repository mainly contains mainstream deep learning and its application technology algorithms such as nlp, cv, 3d, vlm, vla, etc. It mainly expands more innovative possibilities of technology through learning the implementation of mainstream cutting-edge technologies and related example demonstrations.
